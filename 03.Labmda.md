## Features of Lambda

- No worries about the server

You don't require server, all you need to do is write the code and upload it to labmda

Which means, you can stop worrying and managing those servers! The only thing Lambda requires to work is your code!

- Automatic Scaling

Scaling is done automatically based on the size of the workload.

It scales the application running the code in response to each trigger

- Metering on the second

You only pay for the amount of time that your code is running

Which means that you're not charged for any of the servers. The only payment required is for the amount of time the code is computed.
